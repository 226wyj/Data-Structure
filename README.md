# Data_Structure
The Implementation of basic data structures and algorithms in multiple programming languages. Hope this repository can help you conquer the difficult but extremely important part of computer science, enjoy and have fun.  :-) 



### Introduction

For most students who majors in Computer Science, Data Structure Course seems to be one of the most difficult courses at the undergraduate study stage. When I was a sophomore, I didn't realize the importance of data structures and I got a very poor grade at that time. I always want to make up for this regret, so I created this repository and decided to learn data structures again. The codes will mainly based on Python for its conciseness. However, considering that implementing some particular data structures such as tree and linked list will need pointers, so there will be some C++ codes as well. Don't worry, I will try to give detailed annotations. Learning the theories is necessary, but knowing how to use the knowledge to write runnable programs is more important. I hope this repository can give you a little help and I wish you can master data structures. Let's do it.

对于大多数计算机专业的学生来说，数据结构应该是本科四年里最难的一门课之一。可能有很多人和我一样，在大二的时候并没有意识到这门课的重要性，因此学得很不好，期末考试也是飘过。为了在找工作时能够顺利通过面试，我决定自己重新学习一遍数据结构。创建这个仓库的目的是希望自己能够将各种数据结构以代码的形式实现出来，而不是仅仅停留在伪代码和算法理论的层面。关于编程语言的选择，考虑到Python的简洁易用性，我将主要以Python来编写代码。但是某些特定数据结构的实现如树、链表等又需要借助指针，这样才可以使其结构更加清晰，因此这类数据结构我将以C++来进行实现。我会尽可能地按照标准接口文档的编写规范给出详细的注释，以此能够方便阅读源码。希望这个repository能够给正在学习数据结构的你带来一些帮助，让我们一起加油。
