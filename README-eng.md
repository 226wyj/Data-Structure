# Data Structures
The Implementation of basic data structures and algorithms in multiple programming languages. Hope this repository can help you conquer the difficult but extremely important part of computer science, enjoy and have fun.  :-) 

### Introduction

For most students who majors in Computer Science, Data Structure Course seems to be one of the most difficult courses at the undergraduate study stage. When I was a sophomore, I didn't realize the importance of data structures and I got a very poor grade at that time. I always want to make up for this regret, so I created this repository and decided to learn data structures again. The codes will mainly based on Python for its conciseness. However, considering that implementing some particular data structures such as tree and linked list will need pointers, so there will be some C++ codes as well. Don't worry, I will try to give detailed annotations. Learning the theories is necessary, but knowing how to use the knowledge to write runnable programs is more important. I hope this repository can give you a little help and I wish you can master data structures. Let's do it.
